# Azure Tech Training day material
This repo is for the hands-on technical training I've delivered. There is an accompanying series of posts on my blog http://www.redbaronofazure.com/?p=7432 that will walk you through the high level scenarios of the traning. 

## Which script should I use?
I've included multiple scripts for the same task so that you can use Powershell and/or CLI at your will.
CLI scripts written for Mac OS have a *-mac.sh name. CLI scripts intended for Windows DOS Command Prompt have a *-win.cmd name. Note that CLI/DOS are not desiged to rn in a Powershell command prompt due to it's use of environment variables. I selected the DOS Command Prompt just because I wanted to show you it works too. Powershell scripts are pretty obvious as they are named *.ps1.

In order for the script to be repeatable, that all have the format of basing the name of the resource derived from your userid and a random number. That way you can run the scripts in a shared subscription.

## Preparing your scripting environment
Install Powershell and CLI and get your environment ready

No scripts included for this part.
